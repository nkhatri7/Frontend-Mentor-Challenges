## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Beautiful DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - Library for Drag and Drop in React

### Continued development

This challenge was rather simple, with the only more difficult feature being the drag and drop feature. However, I could not figure out how to get the gradient border working for the checkbox hover, I tried using `border-image`, `border-image-source` and things like that but they didn't work properly for me. I want to complete the e-commerce site challenge next and then move onto the advanced challenges.
