## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Continued development

This was a rather basic challenge as I have been a bit more busy with uni at the time and so I wanted a lighter challenge to continue coding everyday. Moving forward, I'd love to continue completed projects with more JavaScript or even creating more React apps.
