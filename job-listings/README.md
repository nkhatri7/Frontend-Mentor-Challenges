## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SCSS

### Continued development

This was a good challenge to practice my React skills and gain confidence using functional components. It was also a good opportunity to practice using `.map()` and `.filter()` to dynamically render elements. I will keep completing the intermediate challenges with React and then move onto the advanced challenges.
