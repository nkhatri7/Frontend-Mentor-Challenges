## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learnt how to use different React features like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `propTypes`. `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` are extremely useful when working with components that use states or props, these were useful when working with the different themes.

### Continued development

I want to continue creating React apps and be more comfortable with using the React library.
