## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- SASS/SCSS

### What I learned

This was my first time using React Router. I learnt how to create different routes and use features like `useParams` and `useNavigate` to help with the dynamic routing and dynamic data flow.

### Continued development

I will now look to focus on learning backend development in node.js (and flask) and hopefully start making fullstack web apps very soon.
