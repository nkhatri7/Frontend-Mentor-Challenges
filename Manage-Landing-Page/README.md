## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This challenge was more to just take a step back and solidify my understanding of the HTML5 best practices and make sure I can do the basics at a high level before moving onto more complex challenges. I will probably complete another rather 'basic' challenge and then move onto the more complicated JavaScript challenges where I might use React again.
