## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- React Context - for global theme storage

### Continued development

I want to continue developing more complex web applications using React. I will also start building certain applications as fullstack applications instead of just frontend applications using JSON files.
