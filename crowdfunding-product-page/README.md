## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) - Accessible modal dialog component for React.js

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the Modal component from React and how all of the in-built methods work. I also learnt a lot about state management in React and how to pass methods onto child components as props – this is really useful when working with states and updating states in the parent component through actions in the child component.

### Continued development

I want to keep creating React apps to further my knowledge and understanding of the library. I am more comfortable with using states and passing information between child and parent components now. I would like to learn how to use React hooks.
