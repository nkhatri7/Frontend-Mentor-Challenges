## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to customise range sliders with CSS and how to create a custom toggle. The range slider was relatively difficult to customise but I'm glad I figured out how to do it with the help of some resource on the Internet.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my JavaScript skills by completing projects that focus more on JavaScript instead of HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Basic Slider Styling](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) - This helped me with the basics of styling a customised range slider.
- [Advanced Slider Styling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18389224/how-to-style-html5-range-input-to-have-different-color-before-and-after-slider) - This helped me with the background colour styling for the slider (having different colours before and after the thumb – like a progression bar).
- [Custom Toggle Styling](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) – This helped me create a customised toggle.
