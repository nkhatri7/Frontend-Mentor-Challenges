## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/)

### What I learned

This is my first ever project using React. While there are better uses for React, I thought I'd complete a simple challenge with it just to get the hang of it. I didn't learn anything new with React in this challenge, I was just practicing what I had learnt from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

### Continued development

I want to keep creating React apps to further my knowledge and understanding of it (my React understanding is very basic right now).
