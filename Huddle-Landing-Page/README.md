## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2)

### What I learned

I learnt how to use semantic HTML5 markup, which is good practice for web developers as it helps with accessibility and SEO. I also learnt how to change the styling of an element when you hover over another element. An example from my code is seen below:

```css
.social-icon:hover .fab {
  color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I feel much more comfortable with CSS now, but there is always more I can learn. I will now be moving onto projects that use JavaScript.
